            This is a nice, short hike to a recently repaired fire lookout. Guidebooks do not include recent upgrades to the trail and road to the trailhead. The trail is no longer only accessible via a scramble, but trail that switchbacks through wildflowers and interesting rock walls which was constructed in 2007. The lookout itself has been repaired, making it a nice lunch stop.

The Snoqualmie Tunnel is part of the 110-mile Palouse to Cascades Trail (formerly the John Wayne Trail). This section is in Iron Horse State Park and is a must do for everyone! Views for most of your trip will be determined by the power of your headlamp, but there will be some sights on the other side. The attraction of this hike is the mysterious, dramatic tunnel itself. However, note that the tunnel is closed November 1st through May 1st, so plan your trip accordingly.

Less well-known is the extensive trail system on the steep slopes east of the railroad tracks, constructed as a WPA project in the 1930s, with wide trails and stone staircases. Today, some of the stonework shows signs of age but the main trails still are well-maintained and in good condition.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit.

            Mount McCausland delivers mountain views, lake views, and even solitude at the summit. The cost? The first three miles of the trail is easy, but the last half mile to the summit is steep and occasionally brushy. Taking a break on that climb is no hardship, though: the hillside is carpeted in berries and the views start early.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            This hike along Baker Lake is a busy, popular trail in summer. It is a nice off season walk though, and is perfect on a crisp, clear winter day. With the leaves off the trees, views that aren't possible in summer emerge; the surrounding peaks and the mossy green silhouettes of the leafless maple trees cover the hillside. A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

            The western Cascades south of Snoqualmie Pass have an incredible collection of old scenic fire lookouts, and this route provides a great experience at the former location of a summit watchtower in a rather secluded pocket of the land near Greenwater. Because the lookout has been abandoned so long, you’ll find only filtered views from the actual summit. Trees have grown up since the heyday of fire suppression, but hikers will still enjoy grand views from the ridge just to the south of the summit. From this perch, about 100 feet below the old lookout station, the views sweep in Mount Rainier and the expanse of the Norse Peak Wilderness.

A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction.

            This hike along Baker Lake is a busy, popular trail in summer. It is a nice off season walk though, and is perfect on a crisp, clear winter day. With the leaves off the trees, views that aren't possible in summer emerge; the surrounding peaks and the mossy green silhouettes of the leafless maple trees cover the hillside. A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction.

Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward.

            Along with the numerous other I-90 hikes there is no shortage of ‘workout’ on this hike. Like its counterparts, this trail is largely for those interested in heading up, steeply. Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward.

This calf-friendly journey is all made possible by a high elevation trailhead, which sets you off on your travels around 3,000 feet, cutting what would otherwise be an arduous ten mile roundtrip in half.

A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction.

            This hike along Baker Lake is a busy, popular trail in summer. It is a nice off season walk though, and is perfect on a crisp, clear winter day. With the leaves off the trees, views that aren't possible in summer emerge; the surrounding peaks and the mossy green silhouettes of the leafless maple trees cover the hillside. A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction.

The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top.

Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward.

            Along with the numerous other I-90 hikes there is no shortage of ‘workout’ on this hike. Like its counterparts, this trail is largely for those interested in heading up, steeply. Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward.

Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward.

Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward.

            Tucked high in the mountains of the Olympic Peninsula, in the appropriately named Valley of Heaven is a breathtaking lake -- the Lake of the Angels. The heavenly goal is accessed by a trail built for more mortal interests. Keep in mind though; if you tackle this trail, it's devilishly difficult. In some places, it requires a vertical climb where falling is not an option. Be prepared, both physically and mentally, for this challenging hike.

Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward.

Even before the historic Paradise Inn was constructed in 1916, the Paradise valley has long been one of the state’s most beloved hiking destinations because of its southern exposure, giving it a longer season than its north side counterpart, Sunrise. In peak season (July and August) your trip along the Skyline Trail will be filled with views of cascading waterfalls, mighty glaciers and subalpine meadows brimming with colorful splashes of lupines, mountain heather, scarlet paintbrush, cascade asters and bistort.

            Mount Ellinor is the southern-most prominence on the eastern front of the Olympics. This makes its peak easy to point out to your friends when you say, ”I was up there.” Mount Ellinor also gives you two trailheads to choose from. The lower trailhead at 2,600 feet welcomes you to the ascent with an easy grade at the outset. The route from the upper trailhead at 3,500 feet starts out with a nearly immediate upward jolt. The trails merge well before the summit and continue upward at a character-building grade.

            The Skyline Trail is the main route for hiking out of Paradise, Mount Rainier’s south side hub and most popular destination, providing visitors a unique opportunity to experience the breathtaking beauty of Washington’s grandest mountain. Even before the historic Paradise Inn was constructed in 1916, the Paradise valley has long been one of the state’s most beloved hiking destinations because of its southern exposure, giving it a longer season than its north side counterpart, Sunrise. In peak season (July and August) your trip along the Skyline Trail will be filled with views of cascading waterfalls, mighty glaciers and subalpine meadows brimming with colorful splashes of lupines, mountain heather, scarlet paintbrush, cascade asters and bistort.

            Named for a Duwamish chief who led a village on Lake Union, this six-mile, mostly-paved urban loop connects pocket parks and multi-use paths around Lake Union in Seattle.  If you don't stop for a bite to eat in one of the neighborhoods along the way, Gasworks Park (on the north side of the loop) and Lake Union Park (on the south side) both make great picnic spots with lake views.

            The Boulder Garden Loop offers an opportunity to explore stone giants on a relatively untraveled path, despite its proximity to two of the busiest hiking thoroughfares in the Snoqualmie Pass region. It also is the access route to the Old Mount Si trail, for those who desire a less peopled approach to the Puget Sound region's most well-known hike.

            Sheep Lake is a picturesque alpine lake guarded by jagged-edged ridges. It makes a good destination for children, especially if you let them swim, play in the meadows, or explore the small rock outcroppings. Sheep Lake is also a worthy destination for adults who want a pause from daily life to enjoy the outdoors. The campsites around the perimeter are ideal for base camping or for backpacking with children.

            The old trail up Mailbox Peak was the stuff of legend. It inspired potential Rainier climbers, challenged adventurous day hikers, and occasionally Mother Nature used the trail to bite back. The number of injuries and rescues on the old trail prompted the Department of Natural Resources to create a new trail to the top. While still relatively steep, this new route, built in part with help from WTA volunteers offers a more easily navigable way for folks to attain the summit of this formidable peak.

            Here's an unusual hike through a very mossy forest and along a narrow river canyon, past sites that were important in local history. A railroad once ran along the canyon, passing through small communities. Logging was done in the area, and lime once was produced from limestone here, in a kiln that still stands. The railroad and communities are gone now, and much has disappeared over the past eighty years. But a few artifacts still remain and can be seen near the trail.

            Logging paid for most of the trails in the Cascades, so sometimes hikers must expect to hike the terrain that provided that rich stock of timber. This trail starts on an old logging road, leads through old clearcuts—now nicely regrown as lush berry meadows and forest stands—and enters lush old second-growth forest. It’s a great way to experience both the natural and human history of the area, while enjoying some remarkable wild country around a pristine alpine lake.

            After you've explored a few trails with your little one, the Heather Lake trail makes a wonderful next step. It's the perfect place to take children on their first ‘real’ hike. The trail is short, but steep and challenging--it'll give a child a real sense of accomplishment once they reach the lake. The lake itself is a scenic little lake located on the northeastern slope of Mount Pilchuck.
